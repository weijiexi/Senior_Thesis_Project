# Project: Touch and Mapping

Yes, the project tech part is based on: `touch`, and `mapping`.
-   **touch**: to use the touch board as a `MIDI Controller`;
-   **mapping**: to use the `MadMapper` to receive the note data from touch board, the `MIDI Controller`. 

## To Use The Touch Board As A MIDI Controller

The Touch Board can be used as a **MIDI controller** to send MIDI note data to Apple `GarageBand` or other creation software (the `MadMapper` in this project) that accepts external MIDI controllers. If one of the Touch Board's electrodes is triggered, the board sends the data to `GarageBand` (or, the `MadMapper`). Using the Touch Board is a great way to create a minimal interface to play your music or trigger the video on Madmapper.

## Set up the videos in MadMapper

The Touch Board can be used as a **MIDI controller** to send MIDI note data to `MadMapper`. Change the video's play settings to "Play the movie to the end of the loop and pause." Now, open the MIDI control settings in MadMapper. Select the video, then click the "Goto beginning" button, then touch the sensor on your wall. The "Goto beginning" button should now be grey and have something written across it, like "1/C2".

## The touch and mapping project

Drag and drop the video into the workspace of MadMapper. Then, map imagery and even sound simultaneously.
